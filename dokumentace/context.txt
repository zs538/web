Context:

You are building a prototype social media website inspired by Tumblr, using SvelteKit for the frontend, Drizzle ORM for data modeling, and SQLite (better-sqlite3) as the database. The project's goals are to support multimedia posts and user authentication, all optimized for rapid local development and prototyping. Registration is not open to the public; users and admins are created manually.

Updated Project Overview
Purpose:
A public, Tumblr-inspired feed of multimedia posts with authentication, infinite scrolling, and simple account management. No comments, no profiles, no likes/reposts, no post details. Admin-ready for moderation.

Core Features
1. Public Infinite Feed (/)
All posts shown, newest at the top

Infinite scroll (load more on scroll, with fade-in animation)

Each post can display up to 4 media items (image, video, audio, embeds)

Gallery for images and videos when clicked on the image/video, similar to discord image view the clicked image takes the focus, blurred background, arrows to navigate between images/videos.
(may not include videos if too complicated)
Zoom for images, custom audio player, video player, embed handling (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.)

Each post shows media (if any), then the text, then info (timestamp, author name)

Posts fade in as they load

2. Navigation Bar (top of all pages)
Left: Logo, links to about page

Right: Icon, links login page, if already logged in homepage

(Optional) Search bar (future)

3. Login Page (/login)
Login prompt for username and password

Animated background for visual interest

If already logged in: redirect to homepage/settings

4. About Page (/about)
Brief about/info, style as desired

5. Page Transition Animations
Animated transitions between main pages

6. Homepage/Settings for Logged-In Users (/me)
Show overview of user’s own posts (list, controls for remove)

Create new post (upload image, video, audio, add YouTube/SoundCloud embed, plus text)

Password reset option

Other settings as needed

--------------------------------

Non-Functional/Tech Requirements
Manual user/admin creation — no public registration

Lucia for authentication/session management

Server-side route protection for post creation/deletion

Drizzle ORM + Better-sqlite3 for the database

Audit log for all key actions (login, post create/delete, etc.)

Seed script for dummy users and posts

Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript for quality

Component-based Svelte UI — modular and scalable

Future-proof for Tailwind, search, themes, etc.
